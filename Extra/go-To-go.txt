 I'm Arindam Das, a QA Engineer with almost 3 years of experience, currently serving as a Full Stack QA professional. 
 In my recent project was in E-commerce domain, and the tech stack for the application included React for the frontend, 
 Java for the backend, and SQL for the database,Throughout this journey, we followed Agile methodologies, fostering efficiency and collaboration.
 
 When it comes to Automation Testing, I harnessed the capabilities of Cypress, a powerful UI automation tool. We followed 
 the Page Object Model design pattern to craft robust test cases, ensuring the functionality and stability of web applications. 
 for reporting we integration of the Cypress automation framework with Cypress Cloud and Git, our chosen version control tool,
 facilitated collaborative development. 
 
In the realm of manual testing, my responsibilities was requirements analysis, test coverage matrix creation test case formulation,
 and test execution. Defect tracking was seamlessly managed through JIRA, and Zephyr was our go-to test management tool.  I'm also 
 familiar with SQL for database testing.
 
During my initial journey into automation, I worked into Java Selenium Automation as well.
